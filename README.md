###### Types of expressions according to the cool mannual:

- Constants
- Identifiers
- Assignment 
- Dispatch
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Blocks
- Let
- Case
- New
- Isvoid
- Arithmetic


We added (Node) structs to represent each of these types of expressions. We also added a struct for : 
* the Program, which is the root of the AST.
* the Class, which represents a class definition.
